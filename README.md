# react-ssr
A simple react ssr example with preboot (yet to integrate preboot)

```
git clone git@github.com:swazza/react-ssr.git
cd react-ssr
yarn install
yarn startClient
// open new terminal window/tab
yarn startServer
```

Once you've run the above commands, you can access the SSR app at localhost:25000 and the non-SSR app at localhost:24000
